# This is exercise for SPBD week2 with Hadoop and IP addresses 
• Using the same docker image of lab 1, do the following
exercises:
• Create a new notebook (or set of notebooks) that
processes the log of web entries using map-reduce to:
1. Count the number of unique IP addresses involved in the
attack.
2. For each interval of 10 seconds, provides the following
information: [number of request, average execution time,
maximum time, minimum time]
3. Create an inverted index that for each interval of 10 second,
has a list of (unique) IPs executing accesses.
